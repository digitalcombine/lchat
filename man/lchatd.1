.SH NAME
lchatd - Local chat daemon and dispatcher.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lchatd
[-d] [-s \fIpath\fR] [-g \fIgroup\fR] [-w \fIpath\fR]
.PP
.B lchatd

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBlchatd\fR is a simple \*(lqIRC-ish\*(rq chat server that dispatches
messages over a local unix socket for a single computer/server. Ideally the
target for this software is for headless servers allowing admins and other
users to easily communicate on the console.
.PP
There is no real protocol involved, what you type is what is send over the
socket. To send a message to everyone, simple send a line of text terminated
by the newline character.
.PP
Private messages can be sent by starting a message with a users name
followed by a colon and a space as follows:
.PP
\fBroot: I wish I had your power!\fR
.PP
Similar to IRC, the chat daemon understands a few command that start with
the / character.
.IP "/quit or /exit"
The server will close the connection.
.IP /who
Displays a line of all the users in the chat session.
.IP "/version or /about"
Displays version information about the server.
.IP /help
Displays a simple help screen.
.PP
Messages sent from the dispatcher to the clients may have some simple
punctuation prepended to it, indicated the source of the message.
line. 
.IP "\*(lqsender: \*(rq"
Normal message sent to all the users from \fIsender\fR.
.IP "\*(lq! sender: \*(rq"
.IP "\*(lq! ^receiver: \*(rq"
Private message sent from \fIsender\fR. When a private message has the
\*(lq^\*(rq symbol before the \fIreceiver\fR's name this message was sent by
the user and returned to the user by the dispatcher to keep the conversation
displayed by the client consistant.
.IP "\*(lq? \*(rq"
Help message sent by the chat server.
.PP
Everything else is considered system information, usually the server
responsing to a server command.
