.Op Fl s | -socket Ar path

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple, configuration free,
.Em IRC-ish
chat server that dispatches messages over a local Unix socket for a single
computer/server.
Ideally the target for this software is for headless servers allowing admins
and other users to easily communicate on the console.
.Pp
There is no real protocol involved, what you type is what is send over the
socket.
To send a message to everyone, simple send a line of text terminated by the
newline character.
.Pp
Similar to IRC, the chat daemon understands a few command that start with the
.Em /
character.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy "/quit, /exit"
The server will close the connection.
.It Sy /who
Returns a list of the current users in the chat room.
The list starts with
.Em ~
so clients can easily identify it to update any user lists it might display.
For example the /who command may return:
.Em ~ root john paul george ringo
.It Sy "/version, /about"
Displays version information about the server.
.It Sy "/msg, /priv, /query user message..."
Sends a private message to the given user.
.It Sy /help
Displays a simple help screen.
.El
.Pp
Messages sent from the dispatcher to the clients may have some simple
punctuation prepended to it, indicated the source of the message.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em sender\&:
Normal message sent to all the users from
.Em sender .
.It Em sender\&:
.It Em ^receiver\&:
Private message sent from
.Em sender .
When a private message has the
.Em ^
symbol before the
.Em receiver's
name the message was sent by the user and returned to the user by the
dispatcher to keep the conversation displayed by the client consistent.
.It Em \&?
Help message sent by the chat server.
.El
.Pp
Everything else is considered system information, usually the server responding
to a server command.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d | -daemon
Puts the program in the background as a system daemon.
.It Fl s | -socket Ar path
Specifies the
.Ar path
to the chat servers Unix socket file.
The default path is
.Em /var/lib/lchat/sock .
.It Fl u | -user Ar user
Specifies the user to change the Unix socket to and if possible change the uid
for
.Nm
as well.
If
.Nm
is started with root privileges and this option
is not specified then the option
.Fl u
.Ar nobody
is the default.
.It Fl g | -group Ar group
Specifies the group to change the Unix socket to and if possible change the gid
for
.Nm
as well.
This should be set to a group for login users only and prevent other system
services from being able to access the chat service.
.It Fl w | -working-directory Ar path
Set the working path for the daemon.
Ideally, this should be set to the directory where the Unix socket is found.
The default is
.Em /var/lib/lchat .
.It Fl V | -version
Displays version information.
.It Fl h | -help
Displays a very brief help screen.
