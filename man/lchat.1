.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBlchat\fR is a simple, configuration free, console chat client. The local
chat suite is a very simple 'IRC-ish' chat system over a unix socket for a
single computer/server. Ideally the target for this software is for headless
servers allowing admins and other users to easily communicate with each other
on the console.
.PP
There is no real protocol involved, what you type is sent exactly as
is. To send a message to everyone, simple type a line and hit enter.
.PP
Private messages can be sent by starting a message with a users name
followed by a colon and a space as follows:
.PP
\fBroot: I wish I had your power!\fR
.PP
Similar to IRC, the chat daemon understands a few command that start with
the / character.
.IP "/quit or /exit"
The server will close the connection.
.IP /who
Updates the all the users in the chat room.
.IP "/version or /about"
Displays version information about the server.
.IP /help
Displays a simple help screen.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-a"
Sets the conversation window to automatically scroll to any new messages that
are received.
.IP "-l scrollback"
Specifies the number of lines to be kept in the scrollback buffer. The default
is 500 lines.
.IP "-m message"
Send message to the chat room. This allows for scripts and other programs to
post messages within the chat room.
.IP "-b bot command"
Instead of bring up a user interface, the chat stream is piped to the
\fIbot command's\fR standard in and out. The conversation is read through
standard in and the bot can send messages to the conversation through standard
out. Note standard error is not redirected and can be used for debugging
purposes.
.IP "-s path"
