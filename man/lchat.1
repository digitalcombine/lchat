.SH NAME
lchat - Local chat console client.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lchat
[-s \fIpath\fR]
.PP
.B lchat
-V

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBlchat\fR is a simple console chat client. The local chat suite is a very
simple 'IRC-ish' chat system over a unix socket for a single computer/server.
Ideally the target for this software is for headless servers allowing admins
and other users to easily communicate on the console.
.PP
There is no real protocol involved, what you type is sent exactly as
is. To send a message to everyone, simple type a line and hit enter.
.PP
Private messages can be sent by starting a message with a users name
followed by a colon and a space as follows:
.PP
\fBroot: I wish I had your power!\fR
.PP
Similar to IRC, the chat daemon understands a few command that start with
the / character.
.IP "/quit or /exit"
The server will close the connection.
.IP /who
Displays a line of all the users in the chat session.
.IP "/version or /about"
Displays version information about the server.
.IP /help
Displays a simple help screen.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-s path"

Specifies the number of lines to be kept in the scrollback buffer. The default is 500 lines.
.IP "-a"
