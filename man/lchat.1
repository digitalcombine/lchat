.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlchat\fR is a simple, configuration free, console chat client. The local chat
suite is a very simple 'IRC-ish' chat system over a unix socket for a single
computer/server. Ideally the target for this software is for headless servers
allowing admins and other users to easily communicate with each other on the
console.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-a"
Sets the conversation window to automatically scroll to any new messages that
are received.
.IP "-l scrollback"
Specifies the number of lines to be kept in the scrollback buffer. The default
is 500 lines.
.IP "-m, -m message"
Send message to the chat room. This allows for scripts and other programs to
post messages within the chat room. If message is excluded from the command line
then it is read from standard in.
.IP "-b 'bot command'"
Instead of bring up a user interface, the chat stream is piped to the \fIbot
command's\fR standard input and output. The conversation is read through
standard input and the bot can send messages to the conversation through
standard output. The standard error is not redirected and can be used for
debugging purposes.
.PP
.RS
All chat messages will be sent to the bot and the bot must read them via
standard input. This includes even when the bot is only outputting messages. If
the bots input is not read this can eventually lockup the \fBlchatd\fR server.
.PP
The \fIbot command\fR is executed via \fIsh -c command\fR. A simple trick to
replace the shell process with the bot command is to use the shell built exec,
for example: \fIlchat -b 'exec my_bot_script.sh'\fR.
.RE
.IP "-s path"
Specifies the \fIpath\fR to the chat servers unix socket file.
.IP -V
Displays version information.
.IP "-h, -?"
Displays a very brief help screen.

.SH USER INTERFACE
The terminal interface is fairly simple. Along the top of the window is simply a
title bar. Just bellow it to the left is the chat window. To the right of that
is the list of all the users in the chat.
.PP
Next is the status lines. On the left side of the status line is the number of
users in the chat. On the right shows the scroll buffer status: the current
line/number of buffered lines.
.PP
Next is a number of icons are shown as various status indicators. If the \fIâ†§\fR
character is displayed the auto scroll feature is enabled otherwise it is
disabled. If an \fIi\fR is displayed it indicates the input is in insert mode an
\fIo\fR indicates the input is in overwrite mode.
.PP
The auto scroll feature always scrolls the chat to show new messages as they are
received. When this feature is turned off the chat display will not be changed
as new message are received. Auto scroll is turn off by default, but can be
turned on with the -a command line option or toggled on or off with CTRL-A.
.PP
At the very bottom is the input window. Here just type you message and hit the
return key to send it. There are several chat server command available which are
described in the next section.

.SH SERVER COMMANDS
Similar to IRC, the chat daemon understands a few commands that start with the /
character.
.IP "/quit, /exit"
The server will close the connection.
.IP /who
This returns a list of all the users currently connected to the chat. lchat
doesn't display this list in the chat window, but rather uses it to update its
user list window and status line.
.IP "/version, /about"
Displays version information about the server.
.IP "/msg, /priv, /query user message..."
Sends a private message to the user.
.IP /help
Displays a simple help screen.

.SH KEY BINDINGS
.IP "Up Arrow and Down Arrow"
Scroll the contents of the chat window up and down respectively.
.IP "Page Up and Page Down"
Scroll the contents of the chat window up and down the number of line being
displayed respectively.
.IP "CTRL-A"
Toggles the auto scrolling feature on and off.
.IP "CTRL-R"
Completely redraws the client.
.IP "CTRL-P"
Changes the input to iterate through past messages sent. The up and down arrow keys list through the message history and the enter key will select the displayed entry. The input allows the selected message to be edited before it is sent.
.PP
The input window has many of the standard editing keys available. The left, right, home and end keys move the cursor. The delete and backspace keys delete characters accordingly. Finally the insert key toggles the input between insert and overwrite modes.

.SH BUGS
Although the \fBlchat\fR client is completely Unicode enabled the input is not
capable yet to handle Unicode input. This is because the internal insert pointer
not be smart enough to work with multi-byte characters yet.

Badly written bots that never read the chat messages from their standard input
can eventually lockup the \fBlchatd\fR server.
