Local Chat Suite
================

The local chat suite is a very simple 'irc-ish' chat system over a unix socket
for a single computer/server. The target for this software is for headless
servers allowing admins or other users to easily communicate on the console.

REQUIREMENTS
============

GNU Automake & Autoconf tools
GNU C++ Compiler Suite
Curses Library

INSTALL
=======

 Building and installing uses the standard GNU automake/autoconf tools. So the
following configure/make will work.

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ make install

 The above will work, but ideally the following compiling flags shown be set
during the configure stage.

$ CXXCFLAGS="-Wall -pedantic -O2" ./configure

USAGE
=====

First the chat daemon need to be started. Ideally it should be started with
it's own system user and all the users that will be using the chat system
should have a common group.

To start the server as a daemon with a unix socket at /var/lib/lchat/sock
for the group 'users'.

$ lchatd -d -g users
$ lchatd -d -s /var/lib/lchat/sock -g users

To use that chat system any user in the 'users' group can now simply use
the lchat program.

$ lchat
$ lchat -s /var/lib/lchat/sock
